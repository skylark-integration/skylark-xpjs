RebornXP
===

RebornXP is an effort to bring back the late 2000's personal computing experience right to your desktop.

I always remembered the nostalgic feeling of Windows XP which is now discontinued and unfortunately gone from everybody's heart, so I decided to continue this project in 2021. It is highly inspired from the metro design of Windows 10.
